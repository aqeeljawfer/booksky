# Booksky

Booksky is a lightweight personal library app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

- Add books with title, author, and short description
- View books in a clean, card-style layout
- Delete books from the library
- Use a popup form for adding new books

This project is ideal for beginners learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling.
